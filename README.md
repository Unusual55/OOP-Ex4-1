# Assignment 4

Assignment 4 for the course Object-Oriented Programming written and programmed by Ofri Tavor and Nir Sasson.

## Overview

In this project we were tasked to create a multi-agent algorithm which can connect to a remote server and using the given API collect the most targets in the given setup.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow the steps in order to clone the project and install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SassonNir/OOP-Ex4.git
   ```

2. This project uses and requires the [Google's serialization/deserialization library for JSON in Java called gson](https://github.com/google/gson):

   Gradle:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.9'
    }
    ```

   Maven:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
        <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
        <version>2.8.9</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

   [Gson jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson) are available from Maven Central.

3. This project also uses and requires the library [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/):

   Maven:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jgrapht</groupId>
        <artifactId>jgrapht-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

### Usage

In order to run the simulation, enter the following command to your terminal

```bash
java -jar ./OOP-Ex4.jar [CASE_NUMBER 0-15]
```

Which will open and load the specified case into the GUI.
